RAHAT is a software-hardware integrated project developed by 220 Volts.

RAHAT ( A Hindi word which means 'relief' in English ) is short for Remote Application for Health Assistance And Tracking.


RAHAT implements sensor technology and internet to assist and track health of remote patients, such as ones in home isolation in COVID-19 Pandemic.
It tracks live temperature and heartbeat data of user with timestamps over the Internetwork.
Using the cloud nearby hospitals or loved ones can access the data, monitor the health status and help the patient if in case of an emergency.
The mobile app based on Flutter framework has been developed as a smart portal for end-users and the monitoring group.


## WHY RAHAT?

1) The current health monitoring systems are not Portable.
2) Most Individuals don't understand Analog Data that well
3) Other options are Complex system and difficult to operate
4) Cross Platform App
5) User need not buy the hardware at all. They can rent it from Hospitals and Clinics.
6) No Infrastructure required
7) Preventing over-crowding at hospitals and clinics
8) Much cheaper alternative than booking a bed in Hospital
9) Easy To Use User Interface



## MOTIVE BEHIND RAHAT

It's simply not possible to allocate every sick person a bed in hospital as:
1) It's expensive
2) Increases load on healthcare system
3) Many people are alone and don't have relatives to look after them
4) Healthcare infrastructure is hardly available in rural areas
5) Extremely difficult to keep track of patients details 24 X 7
